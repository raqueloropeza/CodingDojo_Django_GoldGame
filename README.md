# CodingDojo_Django_GoldGame
Built a Django project to create a mini game that allows the user to win or lose gold.  

When you start the game, the user should have 0 gold. The user can go to different places (farm, cave, house, casino) and earn different amounts of gold. 
In the case of a casino, the user can earn or lose up to 50 gold. 
The web app allows the user to earn gold and to display past activities of the game.

1. Have the four forms appear when the user goes to the index route:  http://localhost
2. Use hidden input tags to create routing rules that allows there to be one route to process multiple post methods in order to pass the hidden input value to the server. 
3. Use an array to add strings to display activity for each time a form is processed. 
4. If gold is lost, have the font be in red for the activity.  
5. If gold is won, have the font be in green for the activtiy.
6. Allow the user to reset the game to play again.
